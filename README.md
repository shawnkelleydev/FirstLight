# FirstLight

First Light is a vanilla JavaScript / HTML / CSS application designed to help Christians start their day.  
It also integrates Crossway's ESV API for random verse presentation and ESV access, and it stores
user data locally in the browser.

First Light.  Find your way for the day.

NOTE: Full Stack version with Node.js / Express / SQL coming soon.
